It supports all Redis commands and focuses on high performance.\n\nInstall with:\n\n    npm install redis\n\n## Usage\n\nSimple example, included as `examples/simple.js`:\n\n```js\nvar redis = require(\"redis\"),\n    client = redis.createClient();\n\n// if you'd like to select database 3, instead of 0 (default), call\n// client.select(3, function() { /* ... */ });\n\nclient.on(\"error\", function (err) {\n    console.log(\"Error \" + err);\n});\n\nclient.set(\"string key\", \"string val\", redis.print);\nclient.hset(\"hash key\", \"hashtest 1\", \"some value\", redis.print);\nclient.hset([\"hash key\", \"hashtest 2\", \"some other value\"], redis.print);\nclient.hkeys(\"hash key\", function (err, replies) {\n    console.log(replies.length + \" replies:\");\n    replies.forEach(function (reply, i) {\n        console.log(\"    \" + i + \": \" + reply);\n    });\n    client.quit();\n});\n```\n\nThis will display:\n\n    mjr:~/work/node_redis (master)$ node example.js\n    Reply: OK\n    Reply: 0\n    Reply: 0\n    2 replies:\n        0: hashtest 1\n        1: hashtest 2\n    mjr:~/work/node_redis (master)$\n\nNote that the API is entire asynchronous. To get data back from the server,\nyou'll need to use a callback. The return value from most of the API is a\nbackpressure indicator.\n\n### Promises\n\nYou can also use node_redis with promises by promisifying node_redis with [bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) as in:\n\n```js\nvar redis = require('redis');\nbluebird.promisifyAll(redis.RedisClient.prototype);\nbluebird.promisifyAll(redis.Multi.prototype);\n```\n\nIt'll add a *Async* to all node_redis functions (e.g. return client.getAsync().then())\n\n```js\n// We expect a value 'foo': 'bar' to be present\n// So instead of writing client.get('foo', cb); you have to write:\nreturn client.getAsync('foo').then(function(res) {\n    console.log(res); // => 'bar'\n});\n\n// Using multi with promises looks like:\n\nreturn client.multi().get('foo').execAsync().then(function(res) {\n    console.log(res); // => 'bar'\n});\n```\n\n### Sending Commands\n\nEach Redis command is exposed as a function on the `client` object.\nAll functions take either an `args` Array plus optional `callback` Function or\na variable number of individual arguments followed by an optional callback.\nHere are examples how to use the api:\n\n```js\nclient.hmset([\"key\", \"test keys 1\", \"test val 1\", \"test keys 2\", \"test val 2\"], function (err, res) {});\n// Works the same as\nclient.hmset(\"key\", [\"test keys 1\", \"test val 1\", \"test keys 2\", \"test val 2\"], function (err, res) {});\n// Or\nclient.hmset(\"key\", \"test keys 1\", \"test val 1\", \"test keys 2\", \"test val 2\", function (err, res) {});\n```\n\nNote that in either form the `callback` is optional:\n\n```js\nclient.set(\"some key\", \"some val\");\nclient.set([\"some other key\", \"some val\"]);\n```\n\nIf the key is missing, reply will be null. Only if the [Redis Command Reference](http://redis.io/commands) states something else it will not be null.\n\n```js\nclient.get(\"missingkey\", function(err, reply) {\n    // reply is null when the key is missing\n    console.log(reply);\n});\n```\n\nFor a list of Redis commands, see [Redis Command Reference](http://redis.io/commands)\n\nThe commands can be specified in uppercase or lowercase for convenience. `client.get()` is the same as `client.GET()`.\n\nMinimal parsing is done on the replies. Commands that return a single line reply return JavaScript Strings,\ninteger replies return JavaScript Numbers, \"bulk\" replies return node Buffers, and \"multi bulk\" replies return a\nJavaScript Array of node Buffers. `HGETALL` returns an Object with Buffers keyed by the hash keys.\n\n# API\n\n## Connection Events\n\n`client` will emit some events about the state of the connection to the Redis server.\n\n### \"ready\"\n\n`client` will emit `ready` once a connection is established. Commands issued before the `ready` event are queued,\nthen replayed just before this event is emitted.\n\n### \"connect\"\n\n`client` will emit `connect` at the same time as it emits `ready` unless `client.options.no_ready_check`\nis set. If this options is set, `connect` will be emitted when the stream is connected.\n\n### \"reconnecting\"\n\n`client` will emit `reconnecting` when trying to reconnect to the Redis server after losing the connection. Listeners\nare passed an object containing `delay` (in ms) and `attempt` (the attempt #) attributes.\n\n### \"error\"\n\n`client` will emit `error` when encountering an error connecting to the Redis server or when any other in node_redis occurs.\n\nSo please attach the error listener to node_redis.\n\n### \"end\"\n\n`client` will emit `end` when an established Redis server connection has closed.\n\n### \"drain\"\n\n`client` will emit `drain` when the TCP connection to the Redis server has been buffering, but is now\nwritable. This event can be used to stream commands in to Redis and adapt to backpressure.\n\nIf the stream is buffering `client.should_buffer` is set to true. Otherwise the variable is always set to false.\nThat way you can decide when to reduce your send rate and resume sending commands when you get `drain`.\n\nYou can also check the return value of each command as it will also return the backpressure indicator.\nIf false is returned the stream had to buffer.\n\n### \"idle\"\n\n`client` will emit `idle` when there are no outstanding commands that are awaiting a response.\n\n## redis.createClient()\nIf you have `redis-server` running on the same computer as node, then the defaults for\nport and host are probably fine and you don't need to supply any arguments. `createClient()` returns a `RedisClient` object.\n\n### overloading\n* `redis.createClient()`\n* `redis.createClient(options)`\n* `redis.createClient(unix_socket, options)`\n* `redis.createClient('redis://user:pass@host:port', options)`\n* `redis.createClient(port, host, options)`\n\n#### `options` is an object with the following possible properties:\n* `host`: *127.0.0.1*; The host to connect to\n* `port`: *6370*; The port to connect to\n* `path`: *null*; The unix socket string to connect to\n* `url`: *null*; The redis url to connect to\n* `parser`: *hiredis*; Which Redis protocol reply parser to use. If `hiredis` is not installed it will fallback to `javascript`.\n* `return_buffers`: *false*; If set to `true`, then all replies will be sent to callbacks as Buffers instead of Strings.\n* `detect_buffers`: *false*; If set to `true`, then replies will be sent to callbacks as Buffers. Please be aware that this can't work properly with the pubsub mode. A subscriber has to either always return strings or buffers.\nif any of the input arguments to the original command were Buffers.\nThis option lets you switch between Buffers and Strings on a per-command basis, whereas `return_buffers` applies to\nevery command on a client.\n* `socket_nodelay`: *true*; Disables the [Nagle algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle%27s_algorithm).\nSetting this option to `false` can result in additional throughput at the cost of more latency.\nMost applications will want this set to `true`.\n* `socket_keepalive` *true*; Whether the keep-alive functionality is enabled on the underlying socket.\n* `no_ready_check`: *false*; When a connection is established to the Redis server, the server might still\nbe loading the database from disk. While loading the server will not respond to any commands. To work around this,\n`node_redis` has a \"ready check\" which sends the `INFO` command to the server. The response from the `INFO` command\nindicates whether the server is ready for more commands. When ready, `node_redis` emits a `ready` event.\nSetting `no_ready_check` to `true` will inhibit this check.\n* `enable_offline_queue`: *true*; By default, if there is no active\nconnection to the redis server, commands are added to a queue and are executed\nonce the connection has been established. Setting `enable_offline_queue` to\n`false` will disable this feature and the callback will be executed immediately\nwith an error, or an error will be emitted if no callback is specified.\n* `retry_max_delay`: *null*; By default every time the client tries to connect and fails the reconnection delay almost doubles.\nThis delay normally grows infinitely, but setting `retry_max_delay` limits it to the maximum value, provided in milliseconds.\n* `connect_timeout`: *3600000*; Setting `connect_timeout` limits total time for client to connect and reconnect.\nThe value is provided in milliseconds and is counted from the moment on a new client is created / a connection is lost. The last retry is going to happen exactly at the timeout time.\nDefault is to try connecting until the default system socket timeout has been exceeded and to try reconnecting until 1h passed.\n* `max_attempts`: *0*; By default client will try reconnecting until connected. Setting `max_attempts`\nlimits total amount of connection tries. Setting this to 1 will prevent any reconnect tries.\n* `auth_pass`: *null*; If set, client will run redis auth command on connect.\n* `family`: *IPv4*; You can force using IPv6 if you set the family to 'IPv6'. See Node.js [net](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html) or [dns](https://nodejs.org/api/dns.html) modules how to use the family type.\n* `disable_resubscribing`: *false*; If set to `true`, a client won't resubscribe after disconnecting\n* `rename_commands`: *null*; pass a object with renamed commands to use those instead of the original functions. See the [redis security topics](http://redis.io/topics/security) for more info.\n* `tls`: an object containing options to pass to [tls.connect](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_port_host_options_callback),\nto set up a TLS connection to Redis (if, for example, it is set up to be accessible via a tunnel).\n* `prefix`: *null*; pass a string to prefix all used keys with that string as prefix e.g. 'namespace:test'\n\n```js\nvar redis = require(\"redis\"),\n    client = redis.createClient({detect_buffers: true});\n\nclient.set(\"foo_rand000000000000\", \"OK\");\n\n// This will return a JavaScript String\nclient.get(\"foo_rand000000000000\", function (err, reply) {\n    console.log(reply.toString()); // Will print `OK`\n});\n\n// This will return a Buffer since original key is specified as a Buffer\nclient.get(new Buffer(\"foo_rand000000000000\"), function (err, reply) {\n    console.log(reply.toString()); // Will print `<Buffer 4f 4b>`\n});\nclient.end();\n```\n\n## client.auth(password[, callback])\n\nWhen connecting to a Redis server that requires authentication, the `AUTH` command must be sent as the\nfirst command after connecting. This can be tricky to coordinate with reconnections, the ready check,\netc. To make this easier, `client.auth()` stashes `password` and will send it after each connection,\nincluding reconnections. `callback` is invoked only once, after the response to the very first\n`AUTH` command sent.\nNOTE: Your call to `client.auth()` should not be inside the ready handler. If\nyou are doing this wrong, `client` will emit an error that looks\nsomething like this `Error: Ready check failed: ERR operation not permitted`.\n\n## client.end([flush])\n\nForcibly close the connection to the Redis server. Note that this does not wait until all replies have been parsed.\nIf you want to exit cleanly, call `client.quit()` to send the `QUIT` command after you have handled all replies.\n\nIf flush is set to true, all still running commands will be rejected instead of ignored after using `.end`.\n\nThis example closes the connection to the Redis server before the replies have been read. You probably don't\nwant to do this:\n\n```js\nvar redis = require(\"redis\"),\n    client = redis.createClient();\n\nclient.set(\"foo_rand000000000000\", \"some fantastic value\");\nclient.end(); // No further commands will be processed\nclient.get(\"foo_rand000000000000\", function (err, reply) {\n    // This won't be called anymore, since flush has not been set to true!\n    console.log(err);\n});\n```\n\n`client.end()` without the flush parameter should not be used in production!\n\n## client.unref()\n\nCall `unref()` on the underlying socket connection to the Redis server, allowing the program to exit once no more commands are pending.\n\nThis is an **experimental** feature, and only supports a subset of the Redis protocol. Any commands where client state is saved on the Redis server, e.g. `*SUBSCRIBE` or the blocking `BL*` commands will *NOT* work with `.unref()`.\n\n```js\nvar redis = require(\"redis\")\nvar client = redis.createClient()\n\n/*\n    Calling unref() will allow this program to exit immediately after the get command finishes. Otherwise the client would hang as long as the client-server connection is alive.\n*/\nclient.unref()\nclient.get(\"foo\", function (err, value){\n    if (err) throw(err)\n    console.log(value)\n})\n```\n\n## Friendlier hash commands\n\nMost Redis commands take a single String or an Array of Strings as arguments, and replies are sent back as a single String or an Array of Strings.\nWhen dealing with hash values, there are a couple of useful exceptions to this.\n\n### client.hgetall(hash, callback)\n\nThe reply from an HGETALL command will be converted into a JavaScript Object by `node_redis`. That way you can interact\nwith the responses using JavaScript syntax.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nclient.hmset(\"hosts\", \"mjr\", \"1\", \"another\", \"23\", \"home\", \"1234\");\nclient.hgetall(\"hosts\", function (err, obj) {\n    console.dir(obj);\n});\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```js\n{ mjr: '1', another: '23', home: '1234' }\n```\n\n### client.hmset(hash, obj[, callback])\n\nMultiple values in a hash can be set by supplying an object:\n\n```js\nclient.HMSET(key2, {\n    \"0123456789\": \"abcdefghij\", // NOTE: key and value will be coerced to strings\n    \"some manner of key\": \"a type of value\"\n});\n```\n\nThe properties and values of this Object will be set as keys and values in the Redis hash.\n\n### client.hmset(hash, key1, val1, ... keyn, valn, [callback])\n\nMultiple values may also be set by supplying a list:\n\n```js\nclient.HMSET(key1, \"0123456789\", \"abcdefghij\", \"some manner of key\", \"a type of value\");\n```\n\n## Publish / Subscribe\n\nHere is a simple example of the API for publish / subscribe. This program opens two\nclient connections, subscribes to a channel on one of them, and publishes to that\nchannel on the other:\n\n```js\nvar redis = require(\"redis\"),\n    client1 = redis.createClient(), client2 = redis.createClient(),\n    msg_count = 0;\n\nclient1.on(\"subscribe\", function (channel, count) {\n    client2.publish(\"a nice channel\", \"I am sending a message.\");\n    client2.publish(\"a nice channel\", \"I am sending a second message.\");\n    client2.publish(\"a nice channel\", \"I am sending my last message.\");\n});\n\nclient1.on(\"message\", function (channel, message) {\n    console.log(\"client1 channel \" + channel + \": \" + message);\n    msg_count += 1;\n    if (msg_count === 3) {\n        client1.unsubscribe();\n        client1.end();\n        client2.end();\n    }\n});\n\nclient1.subscribe(\"a nice channel\");\n```\n\nWhen a client issues a `SUBSCRIBE` or `PSUBSCRIBE`, that connection is put into a \"subscriber\" mode.\nAt that point, only commands that modify the subscription set are valid. When the subscription\nset is empty, the connection is put back into regular mode.\n\nIf you need to send regular commands to Redis while in subscriber mode, just open another connection.\n\n## Subscriber Events\n\nIf a client has subscriptions active, it may emit these events:\n\n### \"message\" (channel, message)\n\nClient will emit `message` for every message received that matches an active subscription.\nListeners are passed the channel name as `channel` and the message Buffer as `message`.\n\n### \"pmessage\" (pattern, channel, message)\n\nClient will emit `pmessage` for every message received that matches an active subscription pattern.\nListeners are passed the original pattern used with `PSUBSCRIBE` as `pattern`, the sending channel\nname as `channel`, and the message Buffer as `message`.\n\n### \"subscribe\" (channel, count)\n\nClient will emit `subscribe` in response to a `SUBSCRIBE` command. Listeners are passed the\nchannel name as `channel` and the new count of subscriptions for this client as `count`.\n\n### \"psubscribe\" (pattern, count)\n\nClient will emit `psubscribe` in response to a `PSUBSCRIBE` command. Listeners are passed the\noriginal pattern as `pattern`, and the new count of subscriptions for this client as `count`.\n\n### \"unsubscribe\" (channel, count)\n\nClient will emit `unsubscribe` in response to a `UNSUBSCRIBE` command. Listeners are passed the\nchannel name as `channel` and the new count of subscriptions for this client as `count`. When\n`count` is 0, this client has left subscriber mode and no more subscriber events will be emitted.\n\n### \"punsubscribe\" (pattern, count)\n\nClient will emit `punsubscribe` in response to a `PUNSUBSCRIBE` command. Listeners are passed the\nchannel name as `channel` and the new count of subscriptions for this client as `count`. When\n`count` is 0, this client has left subscriber mode and no more subscriber events will be emitted.\n\n## client.multi([commands])\n\n`MULTI` commands are queued up until an `EXEC` is issued, and then all commands are run atomically by\nRedis. The interface in `node_redis` is to return an individual `Multi` object by calling `client.multi()`.\nIf any command fails to queue, all commands are rolled back and none is going to be executed (For further information look at [transactions](http://redis.io/topics/transactions)).\n\n```js\nvar redis  = require(\"./index\"),\n    client = redis.createClient(), set_size = 20;\n\nclient.sadd(\"bigset\", \"a member\");\nclient.sadd(\"bigset\", \"another member\");\n\nwhile (set_size > 0) {\n    client.sadd(\"bigset\", \"member \" + set_size);\n    set_size -= 1;\n}\n\n// multi chain with an individual callback\nclient.multi()\n    .scard(\"bigset\")\n    .smembers(\"bigset\")\n    .keys(\"*\", function (err, replies) {\n        // NOTE: code in this callback is NOT atomic\n        // this only happens after the the .exec call finishes.\n        client.mget(replies, redis.print);\n    })\n    .dbsize()\n    .exec(function (err, replies) {\n        console.log(\"MULTI got \" + replies.length + \" replies\");\n        replies.forEach(function (reply, index) {\n            console.log(\"Reply \" + index + \": \" + reply.toString());\n        });\n    });\n```\n\n### Multi.exec([callback])\n\n`client.multi()` is a constructor that returns a `Multi` object. `Multi` objects share all of the\nsame command methods as `client` objects do. Commands are queued up inside the `Multi` object\nuntil `Multi.exec()` is invoked.\n\nIf your code contains an syntax error an EXECABORT error is going to be thrown and all commands are going to be aborted. That error contains a `.errors` property that contains the concret errors.\nIf all commands were queued successfully and an error is thrown by redis while processing the commands that error is going to be returned in the result array! No other command is going to be aborted though than the onces failing.\n\nYou can either chain together `MULTI` commands as in the above example, or you can queue individual\ncommands while still sending regular client command as in this example:\n\n```js\nvar redis  = require(\"redis\"),\n    client = redis.createClient(), multi;\n\n// start a separate multi command queue\nmulti = client.multi();\nmulti.incr(\"incr thing\", redis.print);\nmulti.incr(\"incr other thing\", redis.print);\n\n// runs immediately\nclient.mset(\"incr thing\", 100, \"incr other thing\", 1, redis.print);\n\n// drains multi queue and runs atomically\nmulti.exec(function (err, replies) {\n    console.log(replies); // 101, 2\n});\n```\n\nIn addition to adding commands to the `MULTI` queue individually, you can also pass an array\nof commands and arguments to the constructor:\n\n```js\nvar redis  = require(\"redis\"),\n    client = redis.createClient(), multi;\n\nclient.multi([\n    [\"mget\", \"multifoo\", \"multibar\", redis.print],\n    [\"incr\", \"multifoo\"],\n    [\"incr\", \"multibar\"]\n]).exec(function (err, replies) {\n    console.log(replies);\n});\n```\n\n### Multi.exec_atomic([callback])\n\nIdentical to Multi.exec but with the difference that executing a single command will not use transactions.\n\n## client.batch([commands])\n\nIdentical to .multi without transactions. This is recommended if you want to execute many commands at once but don't have to rely on transactions.\n\n`BATCH` commands are queued up until an `EXEC` is issued, and then all commands are run atomically by\nRedis. The interface in `node_redis` is to return an individual `Batch` object by calling `client.batch()`.\nThe only difference between .batch and .multi is that no transaction is going to be used.\nBe aware that the errors are - just like in multi statements - in the result. Otherwise both, errors and results could be returned at the same time.\n\nIf you fire many commands at once this is going to **boost the execution speed by up to 400%** [sic!] compared to fireing the same commands in a loop without waiting for the result! See the benchmarks for further comparison. Please remember that all commands are kept in memory until they are fired.\n\n## Monitor mode\n\nRedis supports the `MONITOR` command, which lets you see all commands received by the Redis server\nacross all client connections, including from other client libraries and other computers.\n\nAfter you send the `MONITOR` command, no other commands are valid on that connection. `node_redis`\nwill emit a `monitor` event for every new monitor message that comes across. The callback for the\n`monitor` event takes a timestamp from the Redis server and an array of command arguments.\n\nHere is a simple example:\n\n```js\nvar client  = require(\"redis\").createClient(),\n    util = require(\"util\");\n\nclient.monitor(function (err, res) {\n    console.log(\"Entering monitoring mode.\");\n});\n\nclient.on(\"monitor\", function (time, args) {\n    console.log(time + \": \" + util.inspect(args));\n});\n```\n\n# Extras\n\nSome other things you might like to know about.\n\n## client.server_info\n\nAfter the ready probe completes, the results from the INFO command are saved in the `client.server_info`\nobject.\n\nThe `versions` key contains an array of the elements of the version string for easy comparison.\n\n    > client.server_info.redis_version\n    '2.3.0'\n    > client.server_info.versions\n    [ 2, 3, 0 ]\n\n## redis.print()\n\nA handy callback function for displaying return values when testing. Example:\n\n```js\nvar redis = require(\"redis\"),\n    client = redis.createClient();\n\nclient.on(\"connect\", function () {\n    client.set(\"foo_rand000000000000\", \"some fantastic value\", redis.print);\n    client.get(\"foo_rand000000000000\", redis.print);\n});\n```\n\nThis will print:\n\n    Reply: OK\n    Reply: some fantastic value\n\nNote that this program will not exit cleanly because the client is still connected.\n\n## Multi-word commands\n\nTo execute redis multi-word commands like `SCRIPT LOAD` or `CLIENT LIST` pass\nthe second word as first parameter:\n\n    client.script('load', 'return 1');\n    client.multi().script('load', 'return 1').exec(...);\n    client.multi([['script', 'load', 'return 1']]).exec(...);\n\n## client.duplicate([options])\n\nDuplicate all current options and return a new redisClient instance. All options passed to the duplicate function are going to replace the original option.\n\n## client.send_command(command_name[, [args][, callback]])\n\nUsed internally to send commands to Redis. Nearly all Redis commands have been added to the `client` object.\nHowever, if new commands are introduced before this library is updated, you can use `send_command()` to send arbitrary commands to Redis.\nThe command has to be lower case.\n\nAll commands are sent as multi-bulk commands. `args` can either be an Array of arguments, or omitted / set to undefined.\n\n## client.connected\n\nBoolean tracking the state of the connection to the Redis server.\n\n## client.command_queue.length\n\nThe number of commands that have been sent to the Redis server but not yet replied to. You can use this to\nenforce some kind of maximum queue depth for commands while connected.\n\nDon't mess with `client.command_queue` though unless you really know what you are doing.\n\n## client.offline_queue.length\n\nThe number of commands that have been queued up for a future connection. You can use this to enforce\nsome kind of maximum queue depth for pre-connection commands.\n\n## client.retry_delay\n\nCurrent delay in milliseconds before a connection retry will be attempted. This starts at `200`.\n\n## client.retry_backoff\n\nMultiplier for future retry timeouts. This should be larger than 1 to add more time between retries.\nDefaults to 1.7. The default initial connection retry is 200, so the second retry will be 340, followed by 578, etc.\n\n### Commands with Optional and Keyword arguments\n\nThis applies to anything that uses an optional `[WITHSCORES]` or `[LIMIT offset count]` in the [redis.io/commands](http://redis.io/commands) documentation.\n\nExample:\n```js\nvar args = [ 'myzset', 1, 'one', 2, 'two', 3, 'three', 99, 'ninety-nine' ];\nclient.zadd(args, function (err, response) {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log('added '+response+' items.');\n\n    // -Infinity and +Infinity also work\n    var args1 = [ 'myzset', '+inf', '-inf' ];\n    client.zrevrangebyscore(args1, function (err, response) {\n        if (err) throw err;\n        console.log('example1', response);\n        // write your code here\n    });\n\n    var max = 3, min = 1, offset = 1, count = 2;\n    var args2 = [ 'myzset', max, min, 'WITHSCORES', 'LIMIT', offset, count ];\n    client.zrevrangebyscore(args2, function (err, response) {\n        if (err) throw err;\n        console.log('example2', response);\n        // write your code here\n    });\n});\n```\n\n## Performance\n\nMuch effort has been spent to make `node_redis` as fast as possible for common\noperations. As pipelining happens naturally from shared connections, overall\nefficiency goes up.\n\nHere are results of `multi_bench.js` which is similar to `redis-benchmark` from the Redis distribution.\n\nhiredis parser (Lenovo T450s i7-5600U):\n\n```\nClient count: 1, node version: 4.2.2, server version: 3.0.3, parser: hiredis\n         PING,         1/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   2/   0.02/   0.00   2501ms total,  47503.80 ops/sec\n         PING,  batch 50/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   2/   0.09/   1.00   2501ms total, 529668.13 ops/sec\n   SET 4B str,         1/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   2/   0.02/   0.00   2501ms total,  41900.04 ops/sec\n   SET 4B str,  batch 50/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   2/   0.14/   1.00   2501ms total, 354658.14 ops/sec\n   SET 4B buf,         1/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   4/   0.04/   0.00   2501ms total,  23499.00 ops/sec\n   SET 4B buf,  batch 50/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   2/   0.31/   1.00   2501ms total, 159836.07 ops/sec\n   GET 4B str,         1/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   4/   0.02/   0.00   2501ms total,  43489.80 ops/sec\n   GET 4B str,  batch 50/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   2/   0.11/   1.00   2501ms total, 444202.32 ops/sec\n   GET 4B buf,         1/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   3/   0.02/   0.00   2501ms total,  38561.38 ops/sec\n   GET 4B buf,  batch 50/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   2/   0.11/   1.00   2501ms total, 452139.14 ops/sec\n SET 4KiB str,         1/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   2/   0.03/   0.00   2501ms total,  32990.80 ops/sec\n SET 4KiB str,  batch 50/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   2/   0.34/   1.00   2501ms total, 146161.54 ops/sec\n SET 4KiB buf,         1/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   1/   0.04/   0.00   2501ms total,  23294.28 ops/sec\n SET 4KiB buf,  batch 50/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   2/   0.36/   1.00   2501ms total, 137584.97 ops/sec\n GET 4KiB str,         1/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   2/   0.03/   0.00   2501ms total,  36350.66 ops/sec\n GET 4KiB str,  batch 50/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   2/   0.32/   1.00   2501ms total, 155157.94 ops/sec\n GET 4KiB buf,         1/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   4/   0.02/   0.00   2501ms total,  39776.49 ops/sec\n GET 4KiB buf,  batch 50/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   2/   0.32/   1.00   2501ms total, 155457.82 ops/sec\n         INCR,         1/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   3/   0.02/   0.00   2501ms total,  43972.41 ops/sec\n         INCR,  batch 50/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   1/   0.12/   1.00   2501ms total, 425809.68 ops/sec\n        LPUSH,         1/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   2/   0.02/   0.00   2501ms total,  38998.40 ops/sec\n        LPUSH,  batch 50/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   4/   0.14/   1.00   2501ms total, 365013.99 ops/sec\n    LRANGE 10,         1/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   2/   0.03/   0.00   2501ms total,  31879.25 ops/sec\n    LRANGE 10,  batch 50/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   1/   0.32/   1.00   2501ms total, 153698.52 ops/sec\n   LRANGE 100,         1/1 min/max/avg/p95:    0/   4/   0.06/   0.00   2501ms total,  16676.13 ops/sec\n   LRANGE 100,  batch 50/1 min/max/avg/p95:    1/   6/   2.03/   2.00   2502ms total,  24520.38 ops/sec\n SET 4MiB str,         1/1 min/max/avg/p95:    1/   6/   2.11/   3.00   2502ms total,    472.82 ops/sec\n SET 4MiB str,  batch 20/1 min/max/avg/p95:   85/ 112/  94.93/ 109.60   2563ms total,    210.69 ops/sec\n SET 4MiB buf,         1/1 min/max/avg/p95:    1/   8/   2.02/   3.00   2502ms total,    490.01 ops/sec\n SET 4MiB buf,  batch 20/1 min/max/avg/p95:   37/  52/  39.48/  46.75   2528ms total,    506.33 ops/sec\n GET 4MiB str,         1/1 min/max/avg/p95:    3/  13/   5.26/   9.00   2504ms total,    190.10 ops/sec\n GET 4MiB str,  batch 20/1 min/max/avg/p95:   70/ 106/  89.36/ 103.75   2503ms total,    223.73 ops/sec\n GET 4MiB buf,         1/1 min/max/avg/p95:    3/  11/   5.04/   8.15   2502ms total,    198.24 ops/sec\n GET 4MiB buf,  batch 20/1 min/max/avg/p95:   70/ 105/  88.07/ 103.00   2554ms total,    227.09 ops/sec\n ```\n\nThe hiredis and js parser should most of the time be on the same level. But if you use Redis for big SUNION/SINTER/LRANGE/ZRANGE hiredis is significantly faster.\nTherefor the hiredis parser is the default used in node_redis. To use `hiredis`, do:\n\n    npm install hiredis redis\n\n## Debugging\n\nTo get debug output run your `node_redis` application with `NODE_DEBUG=redis`.\n\n## How to Contribute\n- Open a pull request or an issue about what you want to implement / change. We're glad for any help!\n - Please be aware that we'll only accept fully tested code.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThe original author of node_redis is [Matthew Ranney](https://github.com/mranney)\n\nThe current lead maintainer is [Ruben Bridgewater](https://github.com/BridgeAR)\n\nMany [others](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis/graphs/contributors) contributed to `node_redis` too. Thanks to all of them!\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n\n### Consolidation: It's time for celebration\n\nRight now there are two great redis clients around and both have some advantages above each other. We speak about ioredis and node_redis. So after talking to each other about how we could improve in working together we (that is @luin and @BridgeAR) decided to work towards a single library on the long run. But step by step.\n\nFirst of all, we want to split small parts of our libraries into others so that we're both able to use the same code. Those libraries are going to be maintained under the NodeRedis organization. This is going to reduce the maintance overhead, allows others to use the very same code, if they need it and it's way easyer for others to contribute to both libraries.\n\nWe're very happy about this step towards working together as we both want to give you the best redis experience possible.\n\nIf you want to join our cause by help maintaining something, please don't hesitate to contact either one of us.\n",
